# Send-Free-Text-Messages
This script allows you to send text messages right from your computer using www.24sms.net. It's a very short script and very easy to understand.

# Requirements:
Selenium for Python (Google it).

# How The SendText Function Works:
This entire script only has 1 function, "SendText". It will return true if your message was sent successfully. Otherwise, it will return false.

### PS: 
This code was originally included in [Trello-Notification-Alert](https://github.com/SethConnell/Trello-Notification-Alert), but I decided to make it a project of its own.
